Analogy:
JDK = Kitchen (ingredients + stove)
JRE = Stove (runtime environment)
JVM = Flame (executes food/cooking process)

6. Compile Time vs Run Time
Compile Time: Errors detected by compiler (javac) → syntax, type errors.
Run Time: Errors occur while executing code in JVM → e.g., NullPointerException, ArithmeticException.

7. Assessment (Practice)
Write a program to print your name and age.
Explain difference between JVM, JRE, and JDK.
Create a simple Java program that outputs “Welcome to Java”.
Steps to compile and run using command line.
Explain how Java achieves platform independence.



📘 Day 2 – Data Types, Variables, Operators, Control Statements

1. Data Types in Java
Java is a statically typed language, meaning every variable must be declared with a data type before use.
Data types are divided into Primitive and Non-Primitive.

🔹 Primitive Data Types (8 total)
These are the building blocks of data manipulation. Stored directly in memory.
Type
Size
Range (approx)
Example
byte
8-bit
-128 to 127
byte b = 10;
short
16-bit
-32,768 to 32,767
short s = 200;
int
32-bit
-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
int age = 25;
long
64-bit
very large numbers (±9e18)
long population = 9000000000L;
float
32-bit
~6–7 decimal digits
float pi = 3.14f;
double
64-bit
~15 decimal digits
double salary = 12345.678;
char
16-bit
Single Unicode character
char grade = 'A';
boolean
1-bit
true or false
boolean isJavaFun = true;
