1. Explain difference between JVM, JRE and JDK:
    JVM (Java Virtual Machine) provides the runtime environment; it's used to run bytecode.     
    JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a set of tools that provide a runtime environment. JRE contains JVM, libraries, and supporting files.    
    JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software environment that includes JRE. JDK includes tools like a compiler and debugger.

2. Write steps to compile and run a Java file from command line
    1. Install JDK.    
    2. Write a Java program,    
	3. Navigate the Java file from command prompt.    
	4. Compile the Java file using javac [filename].    
	5. To run the Java file using the java [filename] command.

3. Explain how Java achieves platform independence
	Java achieves platform independence through the bytecode that we can run anywhere; 
	simply, we can write code one time and run it multiple times on any platform.
