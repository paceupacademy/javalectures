Que 1. What are access specifiers in Java? List and explain each.
ANS:  Access Specifiers are used to set the visibility of classes, methods and variables.
	List of Access specifiers:
	A. PUBLIC:
		It is accessible  anywhere (Inside and outside the package). 
		From outside package we have to access using the inheritance or using the object creation.
		
		public class PubAccess {
		    public int a;
		    public void display() {
		        System.out.println("Public access");
		    }
		}
		
	B. PROTECTED:
		It is accessible within class and subclass(other package).
		
		class ProAccess {
		    protected int b;
		}
		
	C. PRIVATE:
		 It is accessible only within the class.
			Class PriAccess{
				private int c;
				public void display() {
		        System.out.println("c");
		    }
		}

Que 2. How does encapsulation help in object-oriented programming?
Ans: Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit.
	 Encapsulation helps in below points:
		a. Data Hiding (Security):
			Only necessary data will shows to the user. other data is hidden.
			Public methods are provided to access and update the values of private variables.
			Data is accessed only through public methods (getters/setters)
			
		b. Maintainability:
			Internal methods can be modify, it won't effect on internal code bcz of external code.
			
		c. Modularity:
			Modularity improves the large system into small, self-contained, well-defined classes (modules) 
			where each class encapsulates its own data and behavior.

Que 3. What is the difference between public and protected access modifiers?
ANS:
 	Modifier	Within Class	Within Package	Subclass (other pkg)	Other Packages
	public			✅				✅					✅					✅
	protected		✅				✅					✅					❌

Que 4. Can private members of a class be accessed from another class? Explain.
Ans: No, private members cannot be accessed directly from another class.
		private restricts access only to the same class. Other classes do not know the private members,
		
		Example to private not accessible:
		class PriAccess {
    		private int a;

    		void setSalary(int a) {
        	this.a = a;
    	}
	}
		
		
		class Test {
   			 public static void main(String[] args) {
        		PriAccess pa = new PriAccess();

        		// pa.a = 50000;   ❌ Compile-time error
   			 }
		}

Que 5. What is the default access modifier and how does it work in Java?
Ans: The default access modifier is used when no access modifier is specified for a class, method, or variable.
	 Default access modifier accessible within the package,
	 To use in another package we have create we have to access using the inheritance or using the object creation.
	 No keyword is used for default access
